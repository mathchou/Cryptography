# Cryptography Python Code

Once you have this file, in order to have all the functions available here, 
simply write (in your Python interpreter or a separate Python file):

```
from midterm import *
```

Then, you can call them as you would call any other function as follows:

```
print(shanks_alg(7, 31, 197))
```

The following algorithms have been implemented: 

1. Extended Euclidean Algorithm (for gcd or modular inverses)
2. Fast Powering
3. Shank's Algorithm
4. Chinese Remainder
5. Pohlig-Hellman 
6. RSA Encrypt/Decrypt
7. Pollard's P-1 Factorization Algorithm


The following algorithms are not yet complete, but will be published soon:
1. Pollard's Rho Method for DLP
